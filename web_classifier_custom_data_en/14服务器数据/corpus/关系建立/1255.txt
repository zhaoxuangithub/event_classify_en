The result was the formation of a tacit strategic anti-Soviet alliance between China and the United States.While Kissinger's diplomacy led to economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides and the establishment of Liaison Offices in the Chinese and American capitals, with serious implications for Indochinese matters, full normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China would not occur until 1979, because the Watergate scandal overshadowed the latter years of the Nixon presidency and because the United States continued to recognize the Republic of China on Taiwan.Kissinger's involvement in Indochina started prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon.
