In particular, on March 11 a militant of Lotta Continua - Francesco Lorusso - was killed by a gunshot to the back (probably fired by a policeman), during charges to disperse a group of persons who had organized a protest against a mass meeting of Communion and Liberation, which was being held that morning at the university.
