A brilliant military tactician, Herman was instrumental in Bart's victory in water balloon combat against Nelson and in the negotiation of the peace treaty between the two combatants in "Bart the General", which is his first and most significant appearance.Herman is often portrayed as a crook, having sold Abraham Simpson a fez by falsely claiming it was previously owned by Napoleon; Herman then advertised Abe's old hat as "the hat McKinley was shot in".
