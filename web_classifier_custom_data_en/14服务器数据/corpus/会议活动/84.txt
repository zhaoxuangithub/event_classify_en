[3]In his keynote address at the Second International Congress of the Spanish language held in Valladolid, Spain, in 2003 entitled "Unity and Diversity of Spanish, Language of Encounters", with regards to "reconquista", Carlos Fuentes said:Well, I've just used an English expression (a reference to having said 'brain trust' in the preceding paragraph) and that brings me back to the American continent, where 400 million men and women, from the Río Bravo to Cape Horn, speak Spanish in what were the domains of the Spanish Crown for 300 years; but in a continent, where, in the north of Mexico, in the United States, another 35 million people also speak Spanish, and not only in the territory that belonged to New Spain first and Mexico until 1848—that southwestern border that extends from Texas to California—but to the north Pacific of Oregon, to the midwest of Chicago and even to the east coast of New York City.For that reason, one speaks of a reconquista (reconquering) of the old territories of the Spanish Empire in North America.
