The EFA co - operates with the larger European Green Party to form The Greens – European Free Alliance ( Greens / EFA ) group in the European Parliament . Prior to its affiliation with The Greens – European Free Alliance , the SNP had previously been allied with the European Progressive Democrats ( 1979–1984 ) , Rainbow Group ( 1989–1994 ) and European Radical Alliance ( 1994–1999).As the UK is no longer a member of the EU , the SNP has no MEPs . The Scottish National Party did not have a clear ideological position until the 1970s , when it sought to explicitly present itself as a social democratic party in terms of party policy and publicity .
