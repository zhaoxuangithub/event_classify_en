[ 40 ] The Times of London was perhaps the first widely respected publication to document the fact that 250,000 Assyrians eventually died in the Ottoman genocide of Christians , a figure which many journalists and scholars have subsequently accepted .... As the Earl of Listowel , speaking in the House of Lords on 28 November 1933 , stated , the Assyrians fought on our side during the war , and made enormous sacrifices , having lost altogether by the end of the War about two - thirds of their total number ..... About half of the Assyrian nation died of murder , disease , or exposure as refugees during the war , according to the head of the Anglican Church , which had a mission to the Assyrians . Scholars have placed the number of Assyrian victims at 250,000 to 500,000 .
