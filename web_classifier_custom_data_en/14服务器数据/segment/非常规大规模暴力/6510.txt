In 473 BC , Taranto signed an alliance with Rhegion , to counter the Messapii , Peuceti , and Lucanians , but the joint armies of the Tarentines and Rhegines were defeated near KailÃ¬a ( modern Ceglie ) , in what Herodotus[26 ] claims to be the greatest slaughter of Greeks in his knowledge , with 3,000 Reggians and uncountable Tarentines killed .
