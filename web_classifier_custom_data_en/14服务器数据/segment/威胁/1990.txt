And into ploughshares beat their swords Nations shall learn war no more . O ' beautiful , for spacious skies But now those skies are threatening They 're beating plowshares into swords For this tired old man that we elected kingCreate a world with no fear Together we 'll cry happy tears See the nations turn Their swords into plowsharesThey will live again in freedom In the garden of the Lord .
