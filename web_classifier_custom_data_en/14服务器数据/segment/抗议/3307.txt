The field focuses on modeling phenomena in cognitive science that have resisted traditional techniques or where traditional models seem to have reached a barrier ( e.g. , human memory[9 ] ) , and modeling preferences in decision theory that seem paradoxical from a traditional rational point of view ( e.g. , preference reversals[10 ] ) .
