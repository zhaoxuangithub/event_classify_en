During the armed resistance against the German occupation of Italy from 1943 , PRI members were part of the provincial National Liberation Committees ( CLN ) , but they did not participate to the national CLN as they did not want to collaborate with Italian monarchists , some of whom were active members of the committee . In 1946 , the PRI gained 4.4 % of the popular vote in the election for a Constituent Assembly , confirming its traditional strongholds .
