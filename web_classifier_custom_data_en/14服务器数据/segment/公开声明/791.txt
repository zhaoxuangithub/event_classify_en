Beria not only publicly denounced the Doctors ' plot as a " fraud " but he instigated the release of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners from the gulags ( prisoners he had had a hand in arresting in the first place ) , brought in a liberal policy towards non - Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union thus reversing decades of Russification and persuaded the Presidium and the Council of Ministers to urge the Ulbricht regime in Germany to slow down the " construction of socialism " and institute liberal economic and political reforms . The surviving party leadership feared Beria and Khrushchev in particular saw him as his most serious rival .
