Facing political persecution , Plekhanov emigrated to Switzerland in 1880 , where he continued in his political activity attempting to overthrow the Tsarist regime in Russia . Although he supported the Bolshevik faction at the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1903 , Plekhanov soon rejected the idea of democratic centralism , and became one of Lenin and Trotsky 's principal antagonists in the 1905 St. Petersburg Soviet . During World War I Plekhanov rallied to the cause of the Entente powers against Germany and he returned home to Russia following the 1917 February Revolution .
