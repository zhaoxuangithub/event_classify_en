By the close of the day , market prices have moved , and the end value is $ 99.If all transactions are treated as occurring at the end of the day , then there is zero start value A , and zero value for average capital , because the day - weight on the inflow is zero , so no modified Dietz return can be calculated . Some such problems are resolved if the modified Dietz method is further adjusted so as to put purchases at the open and sales at the close , but more sophisticated exception - handling produces better results . There are sometimes other difficulties when decomposing portfolio returns , if all transactions are treated as occurring at a single point during the day . For example , consider a fund opening with just $ 100 of a single stock that is sold for $ 110 during the day .
