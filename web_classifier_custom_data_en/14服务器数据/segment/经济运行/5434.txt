The ringgit spiked at 3.73 MYR / USD by March 2009 , before gradually recovering to 3.00 MYR / USD by mid-2011 and normalising at around 3.10 MYR / USD between 2011 and 2014.The ringgit would experience more acute plunges in the value since mid-2014 following the escalation of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal that raised allegations of political channeling of billions of ringgit to off - shore accounts , and uncertainty from the 2015â€“16 Chinese stock market turbulence and the effects of the 2016 United States presidential election results .
