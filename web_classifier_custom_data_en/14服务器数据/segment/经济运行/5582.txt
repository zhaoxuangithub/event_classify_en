After Bilzerian was convicted hostile takeovers ended for the most part as it became clear the government would go to any lengths to punish corporate raiders . British raider Beazer also launched several successful hostile takeovers in the 1980s , the largest being that of Koppers in early 1988 for $ 1.81 billion ( $ 4.1 billion today).Many of the corporate raiders of the 1980s were onetime clients of Michael Milken , whose investment banking firm , Drexel Burnham Lambert helped raise blind pools of capital which corporate raiders could use to make legitimate attempts to take over companies and provide high - yield debt financing of the buyouts . Drexel Burnham raised a $ 100 million blind pool in 1984 for Nelson Peltz and his holding company Triangle Industries ( later Triarc ) to give credibility for takeovers , representing the first major blind pool raised for this purpose .
