[ 2]In general , the WACC can be calculated with the following formula:[3]WACC = ∑ i = 1 N r i ⋅ M V i ∑ i = 1 N M V i { \displaystyle { \text{WACC}}={\frac { \sum _ { i=1}^{N}r_{i}\cdot MV_{i}}{\sum _ { i=1}^{N}MV_{i}}}}where N { \displaystyle N } is the number of sources of capital ( securities , types of liabilities ) ; r i { \displaystyle r_{i } } is the required rate of return for security i { \displaystyle i } ; and M V i { \displaystyle MV_{i } } is the market value of all outstanding securities i { \displaystyle i } .In the case where the company is financed with only equity and debt , the average cost of capital is computed as follows : WACC = D D + E K d + E D + E K e { \displaystyle { \text{WACC}}={\frac { D}{D+E}}K_{d}+{\frac { E}{D+E}}K_{e}}where D { \displaystyle D } is the total debt , E { \displaystyle E } is the total shareholder 's equity , K d { \displaystyle K_{d } } is the cost of debt , and K e { \displaystyle K_{e } } is the cost of equity .
