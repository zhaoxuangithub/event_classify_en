If we multiply this by the 20 percent weight of the shares in the portfolio , the result is only 2 percent , but the correct contribution is 8 percent . The answer is to use the return on the shares over the unadjusted full - year period to calculate the contribution : Then the contribution from the shares to the portfolio return is : This does not mean that the correct holding period return on the shares is 40 percent , but for calculation of the contribution , use the unadjusted period return , which is the 40 percent figure , not the actual 10 percent holding period return . To measure returns net of fees , allow the value of the portfolio to be reduced by the amount of the fees .
