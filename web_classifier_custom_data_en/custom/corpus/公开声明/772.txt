Chamberlain, briefly the President of the Local Government Board in 1886, then left the Liberals to form the Liberal Unionist Party and brought the proposal to his new Conservative allies, who won the 1886 United Kingdom general election shortly afterwards.In 1888 Chamberlain again called for democratically-elected county councils in Ireland, as a part of a crash programme of state-funded public works, in his book "A Unionist Policy for Ireland".Directly elected county councils were introduced to England and Wales by the Local Government Act 1888 and to Scotland by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889.
