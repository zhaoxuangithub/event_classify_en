[11] The World Bioenergy Association (WBA) subsequently joined the REN Alliance in June 2009.The Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol,[12] is a comprehensive tool to assess the sustainability of hydropower projects.It was launched in June 2011 at the International Hydropower Association (IHA) World Congress.It provides a thorough, evidence-based assessment of between 19-23 relevant sustainability topics, depending on the development stage of the project.The Protocol is the product of a rigorous multi-stakeholder development process between 2008 and 2010, involving representatives from social and environmental NGOs (Oxfam, Nature Conservancy, Transparency International, WWF); governments (China, Germany, Iceland, Norway, Zambia); commercial and development banks (including banks that are signatory to the Equator Principles, and the World Bank); and the hydropower sector, represented by IHA.The Protocol development process included field trials in 16 countries, across six continents, and stakeholder engagement with 1,933 individuals in 28 countries.The topics cover the three pillars of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental, and include issues such as downstream flow regimes, indigenous peoples, biodiversity, infrastructure safety, resettlement, water quality, and erosion and sedimentation.The assessment tools are used as a framework to produce a sustainability profile for a hydropower project.
