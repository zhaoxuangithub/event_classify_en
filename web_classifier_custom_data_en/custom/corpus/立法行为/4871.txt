In 1683, the Assembly of New York had passed a similar Charter of Liberties and Privileges asserting that "supreme legislative power should forever be and reside in the Governor, council and people, met in general assembly", and enumerated citizen's rightsâ€”taxation voted only by citizen's representatives, trial by peers, exemption from martial law and quartering of soldiers, and religious toleration.After his 1748 visit to New York, Massachusetts Governor William Shirley wrote of the New York Assembly, "They seem to have left scarcely any part of His Majesty's prerogative untouched, and they have gone great lengths toward getting the Government, military as well as civil, into their hands."
