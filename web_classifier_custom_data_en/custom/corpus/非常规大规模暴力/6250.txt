Similarly to European Jews, specifically the Ashkenazi, the Romani people quickly acquired European genetics via enslavement and intermarriage upon their arrival in Europe 1,000 years ago.In the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the Nazi genocide of the Romani was so thorough that it exterminated the majority of Bohemian Romani speakers, eventually leading to the language's extinction in 1970 with the death of its last known speaker, Hana Šebková.
