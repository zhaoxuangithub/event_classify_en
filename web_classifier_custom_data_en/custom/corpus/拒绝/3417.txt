In Quebec politics, le beau risque (French pronunciation: ​[lə bo ʁisk], the noble risk or the good risk) is a political catch phrase describing the "risk" the Parti Québécois (PQ or "péquistes") took in asking Quebecers to support federal Progressive Conservatives (PCs or "Tories") under Brian Mulroney and accept an amended version of the Constitution Act, 1982, which the péquiste Quebec government under René Lévesque has previously refused to sign.
