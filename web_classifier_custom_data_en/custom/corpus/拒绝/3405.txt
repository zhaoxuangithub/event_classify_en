Far from being irrational, as it can seem to non-Arab observers when, in Salsman's example, Arab states refuse to accept aid from Israel after earthquakes and other disasters, rejectionism is consistent with a culture rooted in tribalism because it utilizes hatred of an external enemy to "diffuse internal discontent," draws on "Arab organizational principles based on opposition," and is seen as a way to defend "honor of the Arabs," viewed as having been challenged by Israel's existence.
