[15]The Posse Comitatus Act , passed in 1878 , generally prohibits Federal military personnel ( except the United States Coast Guard ) and units of the United States National Guard under Federal authority from acting in a law enforcement capacity within the United States , except where expressly authorized by the Constitution or Congress . The original act only referred to the Army , but the Air Force was added in 1956 and the Navy and Marine Corps have been included by a regulation of the Department of Defense .
