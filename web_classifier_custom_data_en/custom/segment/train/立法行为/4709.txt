In 1956 , a private bill sponsored by Liverpool City Council was brought before Parliament to create Llyn Celyn reservoir , thus circumventing planning consent from the relevant Welsh local authorities , by obtaining authority via a parliamentary Act . Despite 35 of the 36 Welsh Members of Parliament ( MPs ) voting against the bill , with the other abstaining , Parliament – with 630 MPs , the majority of members represented constituencies in England – still passed the bill .
