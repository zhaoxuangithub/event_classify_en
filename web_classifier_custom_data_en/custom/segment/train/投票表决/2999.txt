The Scottish Green Party and the Scottish Socialist Party ran only one constituency candidate each in the 2007 election - Greens in Glasgow Kelvin , SSP in Paisley North - so constituency values in polls for those parties have little meaning . ICM , Ipsos MORI , Populus , YouGov and TNS System Three ( a subsidiary of Taylor Nelson Sofres ) are all members of the British Polling Council ( BPC ) , and therefore fully disclose the methodology used , and publish tables of the detailed statistical findings .
