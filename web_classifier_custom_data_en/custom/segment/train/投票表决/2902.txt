On January 19 , 2007 , an Erie County grand jury voted to indict Sanchez for the murders of Yalem and Mazur . Many of the rapes attributed to Sanchez were unprosecuted due to the statute of limitations on the prosecution of rape that was in effect in New York at the time those crimes were committed .
