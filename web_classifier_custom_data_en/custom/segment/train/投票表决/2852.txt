To break the existing 33 to 33 vote tie at the Basque autonomous Parliament , the referendum call received the tactical support of one of the EHAK MPs , considered by a Basque PP councillor as ETA 's political arm,[3 ] while the other 7 MPs of this party abstained . Ibarretxe preferred to call the vote a " consultation " rather than a referendum[4 ] and stated he would negotiate its terms with the Spanish central government until June 2008 and then would submit a possible mutually accepted plan to a binding referendum ; should the negotiations fail .
