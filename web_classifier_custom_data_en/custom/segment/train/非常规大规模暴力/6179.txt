The Soviet Union also had the facilities to produce chemical weapons but their development was kept secret . During the 1980 - 88 Iran-Iraq War , Iraq is known to have employed a variety of chemical weapons against Iranian forces , as well as nerve agents against Kurdish civilians , the most notorious example of which was 1988 attack on Halabja . Both the Syrian government and opposition forces accused each other of using chemical weapons in 2013 in Ghouta and Khan al-Assal during the Syrian civil war , though as any such use would be within Syria 's own borders , rather than in warfare between state parties to the protocol , the legal situation is less certain .
