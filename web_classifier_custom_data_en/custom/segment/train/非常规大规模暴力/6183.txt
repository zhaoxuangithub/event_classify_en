The Tiananmen massacre of 1989 strengthened anti-Beijing sentiments and also led to the emergence of the local democracy movement , which demanded a faster pace of democratisation before and after 1997.Since 1997 , the implementation of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45 and Article 68 , which states that the Chief Executive ( CE ) and the Legislative Council ( LegCo ) should be chosen by universal suffrage , has dominated the political agenda in Hong Kong .
