In 1990 West Germany and East Germany jointly signed the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany ( also known as the " Two-plus-Four Agreement " ) ; by which transitional status of Germany following World War II was definitively ended and the Four Allied powers relinquished their joint residual sovereign authority for Germany as a whole including the area of West Berlin which had officially remained under Allied occupation for the purposes of international and GDR law ( a status that the Western countries applied to Berlin as a whole despite the Soviets declaring the end of occupation of East Berlin unilaterally many decades before ) .
