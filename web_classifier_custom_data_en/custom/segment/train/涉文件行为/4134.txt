The organization of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) is based upon the Leninist idea of democratic centralism . In May 2013 , the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a resolution on which bodies were empowered to draft , approve , publish , amend and abolish party regulations , making it the first party document since 1921 ( when the party was founded ) on how to regulate party life .
