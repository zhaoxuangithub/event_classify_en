[24]Political uncertainty following the country 's 2008 general election and the 2008 Permatang Pauh by-election , falling crude oil prices in the late-2000s , and the lack of intervention by Bank Negara to increase already low interest rates ( which remained at 3.5 % between April 2006 and November 2008)[25 ] led to a slight fall of the ringgit 's value against the US dollar between May and July 2008 , followed by a sharper drop between August and September of the same year .
