During the Russo-Japanese War , many bandit groups actively cooperated with the Japanese Army , providing valuable military intelligence on Russian troop movements and deployment , and assisting in the securing of supplies . After December 1931 , the Japanese Army began operations " for the clearance of bandits " into the Fengtien countryside beyond the South Manchuria Railway Zone in counties west of Mukden , largely due to repeated bandit attacks , robberies and kidnappings on the Dalian-Mukden trains .
