A bomb threat or bomb scare is a threat , usually verbal or written , to detonate an explosive or incendiary device to cause property damage , death , injuries , and/or incite fear,[1][2 ] whether or not such a device actually exists . Bomb threats were used to incite fear and violence during the American Civil Rights Movement , during which leader of the movement Martin Luther King Jr. received multiple bomb threats during public addresses,[3][4][5 ] and schools forced to integrate faced strong opposition , resulting in 43 bomb threats against Central High School in Arkansas being broadcast on TV and the radio .
