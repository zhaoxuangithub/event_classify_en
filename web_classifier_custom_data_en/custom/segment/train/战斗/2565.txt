The Hittite kings are held to be ghost doubles of the Neo-Babylonian kings , and Rameses II 's battle with the Hittites at Kadesh is identical to Necho 's fight against Nebuchadrezzar II at Carchemish , Nabopolassar is Mursili II , Neriglissar is Muwatalli , Labashi-Marduk is Urhi-Teshup , and Nebuchadrezzar II is Hattusili III .
