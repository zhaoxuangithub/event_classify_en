Rejecting claimed Soviet sovereignty over the Baltic states , allied officials also refused to repatriate Lithuanian , Estonian , and Latvian refugees against their will . Similarly , many refugees who were repatriated to Yugoslavia were subjected to summary executions and torture . Many Poles , who later agreed to be repatriated , did in fact suffer arrest and some were executed , particularly those that had served in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 , or in the Polish Resistance against the Nazis . Jewish survivors of the death camps and various work camps refused to return to their countries of origin , starting instead an extensive underground movement to migrate to the British Mandate of Palestine .
