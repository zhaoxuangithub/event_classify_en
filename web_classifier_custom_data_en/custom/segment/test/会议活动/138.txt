The Laigh Kirk , Paisley was a congregation of the Church of Scotland and the original Burgh church of Paisley . The Laigh Kirk was founded in August 1738 [ 1 ] by the Burgh of Paisley and by the Presbytery of Paisley as the parish church for the whole burgh , in response to the burgeoning population of Paisley and the dilapidated state of Paisley Abbey which , at that time , was outside of the Burgh limits on the opposite ( western ) bank of the River Cart . The Burgh and town of Paisley were formally disjoined as a parish from the old Parish of Paisley , which had served a large geographic area , at the August 1738 meeting of Paisley Presbytery , with the cover page of the first minute book of the church declaring it to be a " record of the Parish of the Burgh of Paisley " .
