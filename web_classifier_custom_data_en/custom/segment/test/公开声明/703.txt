Wolfson called for the creation of a campaign that reflected what he called the " 4 multi 's " : it would be multi-year ( not expected to win overnight ) , multi-state ( not watching as victories were picked off one by one ) , multi-partner ( no one organization could do it all ) , and multi-methodology ( it would combine litigation , lobbying , public education , organization , direct action , fund-raising , and even , eventually , electoral ) .
